# Tips for reading the Bitcoin whitepaper

## for traditional finance professionals and other less-technical folks

This repository houses a medium article I wrote targeted at traditional finance professionals and other less-technical folks on how to go about reading the [Bitcoin whitepaper] <https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf>.

In this article, I share questions I had when first reading the Bitcoin whitepaper, strategies I used to find answers to those questions, and some personal best practices for reading whitepapers I've developed since becoming more technically savvy.

If you have any feedback for me about this article, please reach out! My goal is to add insights from others to do my part in educating the world about Bitcoin.

I have enabled Issues on this repository for feedback, and my DMs are also open on Twitter @_samcasey.
