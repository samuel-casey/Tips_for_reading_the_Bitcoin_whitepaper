### Tips for reading the Bitcoin whitepaper

> for less-technical Bitcoin newcomers

---

### Introduction

I first became fascinated with Bitcoin a few months after the mania of 2017 died down. When the price fell dramatically, and investors that I looked up to like [Preston Pysh](https://twitter.com/PrestonPysh) were still talking about it, it became clear to me that Bitcoin wasn’t going anywhere.

I had no idea where to start learning, so I turned to LinkedIn to see if I was connected to anyone who worked in the space. Luckily enough, [Justin Gregorious](https://twitter.com/jtgregorius) (who works at CoinList) went to Boston College with a buddy of mine from an internship.

Justin recommended I read [Cryptoassets](https://www.amazon.com/Cryptoassets-Innovative-Investors-Bitcoin-Beyond/dp/1260026671) by Chris Burniske and get on twitter. I took his advice, and immediately got hooked for good. Still, I didn't feel ready to read something so daunting as the [Bitcoin Whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf).

A few months of twitter scrolling later, I started as a strategy analyst at Fidelity, where I attended a crypto-101 presentation led by [Andy Fowler](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andy-fowler-cfa-131a8529/). Soon after, I read [The Bitcoin Standard](https://www.amazon.com/Bitcoin-Standard-Decentralized-Alternative-Central/dp/1119473861) per the recommendation of [Brian Wright](https://twitter.com/brian_wright21?s=20).

It was only after reading two books and talking to multiple people who knew more than me that I finally felt ready to read the whitepaper.

*Waiting so long to read the Bitcoin whitepaper is my biggest regret to date in how I’ve gone about learning crypto. I held off on reading it for so long because I had a lot of questions I felt I needed answers to before investing the time in actually reading it.*

**In this article, I share 3 of the questions I had when first reading the Bitcoin whitepaper and strategies I used to find answers to them, in hopes of inspiring more newcomers to read it sooner than I did.**

### 3 Questions I had when first reading the Bitcoin whitepaper and how I went about finding answers to them

### Q1: Do I need to understand all of the technical language in the whitepaper to get value from reading it?

A1: The short answer to this question is “no”. The longer answer is “no, but that’s because you’ll probably understand more than you think.”

Reading books before the whitepaper gave me a little bit of background on the the technical aspects Bitcoin, but I still didn’t fully understand what terms like “Hash”, “Merkle Tree”, or “Timestamp Server” meant.

When I finally did read the paper, I realized that I didn’t have to understand every word to gain a better technical understanding of the Bitcoin blockchain.

The whitepaper is well written, concise, and includes diagrams that help explain the core concepts of Bitcoin without having to understand every word.

**How I came to this answer:**

> The way I found an answer to this question was by asking someone who had already read the whitepaper. Without asking Brian and Andy this exact question, there is no way I would have been exposed to resources like [coindesk Learn](https://www.coindesk.com/learn), or [Jameson Lopp’s website](https://www.lopp.net/bitcoin-information/getting-started.html).

> When overwhelmed by the technical aspects of crypto, start with a synopsis of the material (if its available). If you don’t know where to look for those resources, ask for help. If I hadn’t checked out these two sites, I wouldn’t have been convinced reading the whitepaper was worth my time.

### Q2: Why should I read the whitepaper if I can just read a less-technical synopsis?

A2: When it comes to Crypto, you should never trust, and always verify.

In my opinion, the most most important aspect of Bitcoin is its transparency.

The fact that anyone with the skills can run a node and verify every single transaction that has ever occurred on the Bitcoin network is something that no bank or traditional financial institution would ever allow.

Could you imagine Bank of America publishing a pseudonymized list of all of their account balances? It would never happen. If it were not for FDIC insurance and cash reserve regulations, we would have little reason to trust that the money held in our bank accounts is actually there for us to withdraw.

Bitcoin solves the trust issue because it is a public blockchain. Reading the whitepaper helped me better understand what exactly public blockchain means, and how they work.

### **How I came to this answer:**

> I don’t think I would have appreciated the mantra “don’t trust, verify” if I hadn’t gotten involved in Crypto Twitter. Crypto Twitter is an interesting place with lots of passionate people; some wise and loud, others just loud.

> After spending a little time wading through the vast sea of Crypto thinkers on twitter, you’ll find some voices that resonate with you, and start to appreciate the importance of trustlessness and verification.

> If you don’t know who to follow to get started on Crypto Twitter, some of my favorite follows for Bitcoin content are Anthony Pompliano, Jameson Lopp, Amiti, and Nic Carter (in no particular order). Check them out and follow some of the same accounts they do. This will help you get your start.

### Q3: How will I know if I understood what I read?

A3: The only way to figure out if you understood the whitepaper is by trying to explain aspects of it to someone else who has very limited or no prior Bitcoin knowledge.

This holds true for pretty much any complex subject you’re learning for the first time, but I’d say it’s especially important for Bitcoin. Bitcoin is only successful because of its network effects, and therefore its important for Bitcoiners to spread the word about its benefits in order for the network to keep thriving.

Most people who use Bitcoin are not, and will never become, technical experts. Despite this fact, most people I’ve introduced to Crypto are able to see the benefits of Bitcoin when I distill the main points of the whitepaper into words they can understand.

**How I came to this answer:**

> Simply put, practice.

> The first person I tried explaining the technical aspects of Bitcoin to was my old roommate. He worked in investment banking with a focus on technology at the time, so I thought he’d “get it” instantly.

> I could not have been more wrong.

He looked at me like a chicken with three heads the first time I tried to explain it, and only after explaining it a few more times was I able to finally get my message across in a way that was understandable to him.

### Conclusion

Getting started learning about Bitcoin is no easy task, but if you’re committed, it’s doable.

The three questions outlined in this article are not exclusive to the [Bitcoin Whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf).

I have asked myself similar questions when first learning about many Crypto concepts over the past few years, and every time I found answers by following the same three basic principles:

1. Start by asking for help.
2. Stick to the principle “don’t trust, verify”. If you trust someone else to explain a complex concept to you, you’ll never truly understand it.
3. Once you think you’ve learned something, try teaching it to someone else. You haven’t actually learned something until you can explain it clearly.
