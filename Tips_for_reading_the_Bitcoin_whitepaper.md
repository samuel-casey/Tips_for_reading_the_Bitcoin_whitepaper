# Tips for reading the Bitcoin whitepaper
> ## *for less-technical Bitcoin newcomers*

---

## Introduction

When I first read the Bitcoin whitepaper, I was a first-year strategy analyst at Fidelity Investments. I first became fascinated with Bitcoin in the spring of 2018, after the mania of 2017 died down, and it became apparent to me that Bitcoin wasn't going anywhere.

I knew there was a whitepaper, because I had heard about it in a podcast, but did not have the technical background to start my Bitcoin education there.

The first step in my Bitcoin education was a phone call with [Justin Gregorious](https://twitter.com/jtgregorius). He recommended I read [Cryptoassets](https://www.amazon.com/Cryptoassets-Innovative-Investors-Bitcoin-Beyond/dp/1260026671) by Chris Burniske, and get on twitter. I took his advice, and got hooked.

The next step in my education was attending Bits-and-Blocks club meetings hosted by Fidelity's Center for Applied Technology, and reading [The Bitcoin Standard](https://www.amazon.com/Bitcoin-Standard-Decentralized-Alternative-Central/dp/1119473861) per the recommendation of my colleague and friend [Brian Wright](<https://twitter.com/brian_wright21?s=20>).

*It was only after reading these two books and attending a crypto-101 presentation led by* [Andy Fowler](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andy-fowler-cfa-131a8529/)*, that I finally had the courage to read the whitepaper.*

## 3 Questions I had when first reading the Bitcoin whitepaper and how I went about finding answers to them

#### Q1: Do I need to understand *all* of the technical language in the whitepaper to get value from reading it?

**A1:** The short answer to this question is "no". The longer answer is "no, but that's because you'll probably understand more than you think."

Reading books before the whitepaper gave me a little bit of background on the the technical aspects Bitcoin, but I still didn't fully understand what terms like "Hash", "Merkle Tree", or  "Timestamp Server" meant.

When I finally did read the paper, I realized that I didn't have to understand every word to gain a better technical understanding of the Bitcoin blockchain.

The whitepaper is well written, concise, and includes diagrams that help explain the core concepts of Bitcoin without having to understand every word. 

##### How I came to this answer:
> **The only way I found an answer to this question was by asking someone who had already read the whitepaper. Without asking Brian and Andy this exact question, there is no way I have been exposed to resources like [coindesk Learn](https://www.coindesk.com/learn), or [Jameson Lopp's website](https://www.lopp.net/bitcoin-information/getting-started.html).** 
>
> **When overwhelmed by the technical aspects of crypto, start with a synopsis of the material (if its available). If you don't know where to look for those resources, ask for help. If I hadn't checked out these two sites, I wouldn't have been convinced reading the whitepaper was worth my time.**

#### Q2: Why should I read the whitepaper if I can just read a synopsis of its principles?

**A2:** When it comes to Crypto, you should never trust, and always verify.

In my opinion, the most most important aspect of Bitcoin is its transparency.

The fact that anyone with the skills can spin up a node and verify every single transaction that has ever occurred on the Bitcoin network is something that no bank or traditional financial institution would ever allow.

Could you imagine Bank of America publishing a psudonymized list of all of their account balances? It would never happen. If it were not for FDIC insurance and reserve regulations, we would have little reason to trust that the money held in our bank accounts is actually there for us to withdraw.

Bitcoin solves this issue of trust because it is a public blockchain. Reading the whitepaper helped me better understand what public blockchain means, and how blockchains work.

##### How I came to this answer:
> 
> **I don't think I would have appreciated the mantra "don't trust, verify" if I hadn't gotten involved in Crypto Twitter. Crypto Twitter is an interesting place with lots of passionate people; some wise and loud, some just loud.**
> 
> **After spending a little time wading through the vast sea of Crypto thinkers on twitter, you'll find some voices that resonate with you, and start to appreciate the importance of trustlessness and verification more.**
> 
> **If you don't know who to follow to get started on Crypto Twitter, some of my favorite follows for Bitcoin content are [Anthony Pompliano](https://twitter.com/APompliano), [Jameson Lopp](https://twitter.com/lopp) and [Nic Carter](https://twitter.com/nic__carter) in no particular order.**

#### Q3: How will I know if I understood what I read?

**A3:** The only way to figure out if you understood the whitepaper is by trying to explain aspects of it to someone else who has very limited or no prior Bitcoin knowledge.

This holds true for pretty much any complex subject you're learning for the first time, but I'd say it's especially important for Bitcoin. Bitcoin is only successful because of its network effects, and therefore its important for Bitcoiners to spread the word about its benefits in order for the network to continue to thrive. 

Most people who use Bitcoin are not, and will never become technical experts. Despite this fact, 
most people I've met are spoken to are able to see the benefits of Bitcoin when I distill the main points of the whitepaper into words they can understand.

##### How I came to this answer:
> **Simply put, practice.**
> 
> **The first person I tried explaining the technical aspects of Bitcoin to was my old roommate. He worked in investment banking with a focus on technology at the time, so I thought he'd "get it" instantly.**
>
>**I could not have been more wrong. He looked at me like a chicken with three heads the first time I tried to explain it, and only after explaining it a few more times was I able to finally get my message across in a way that was understandable to him.**

## Conclusion

Getting started learning about Bitcoin is no easy task, but if you're committed, it's doable.

The three questions outlined in this article are not exclusive to the Bitcoin whitepaper. I have asked myself similar questions when first learning about many Crypto concepts over the course of the past two years, and every time I found answers by following the same three basic principles:

1. Start by asking for help.

2. Stick to the principle "don't trust, verify". If you trust someone else to explain a complex concept to you, you'll never truly understand it.
   
3. Once you think you've learned something, try teaching it to someone else. You've never truly learned something until you can explain it clearly.
