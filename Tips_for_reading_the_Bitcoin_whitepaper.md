# Tips for reading the Bitcoin whitepaper
> ## *for traditional finance professionals and other less-technical folks*

## Introduction

When I first read the Bitcoin whitepaper, I was a first-year strategy analyst at Fidelity Investments. I first became fascinated with Bitcoin in the spring of 2018, after the mania of 2017 died down, and it became apparent to me that Bitcoin wasn't going anywhere.

I knew there was a whitepaper, because I had heard about it in a podcast, but did not have the technical background to start my Bitcoin education there.

The first step in my Bitcoin education was a phone call with Justin Gregorious of Coinlist[@jtgregorious](https://twitter.com/jtgregorius). He recommended I read Cryptoassets by Chris Burniske, and get on twitter. I took his advice, and got hooked.

The next step in my education was attending Bits-and-Blocks club meetings hosted by Fidelity's Center for Applied Technology, and reading [The Bitcoin Standard]() per the recommendation of my colleague and friend [Brian Wright](<https://twitter.com/brian_wright21?s=20>).

*It was only after reading these two books and attending a crypto-101 presentation led by [Andy Fowler of Fidleity](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andy-fowler-cfa-131a8529/), that I finally had the courage to read the whitepaper.* 

**Waiting so long to read the Bitcoin whitepaper is my biggest regret to date in how I've gone about learning crypto.**
